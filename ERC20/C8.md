# Done!

Congratulations! You have completed writing a very barebones but functional ERC20 smart contract. Now you can go deploy it on the Ethereum network and make a million trillion dollars in your upcoming ICO ;)

You can start writing your own smart contracts, test deployment, interact with the deployed contracts, and finally deploy your contract(s) on the Ethereum mainnet using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org
) or [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/).

Remix should be simple enough. Install [Metamask](https://metamask.io) for injecting a blockchain instance into your browser. Then, you will be able to switch between the testnet and the mainnet. Use testnet for development purposes, and only use mainnet when you are finished developing the contract.

Truffle is a little bit harder to set up than remix, since it is not a browser-based development environment. However, they provide many useful tutorials on how to set up an environment for smart contract development, [which can be found here](https://www.trufflesuite.com/tutorials). Truffle is widely used as the development environment for smart contract projects.

When you are done with your smart contract, there are still things to do. Unless you want the users of your smart contract to manually write out all calls to the contract, you will have to build a front end for the users to interact with the smart contract.

In the front end, there has to be a package that connects the built front end and the Ethereum blockchain back end. Web3 is the go-to API for javascript for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. [Here is a tutorial that will guide you through the process of publishing your contract and creating a Javascript front-end for it](https://medium.com/@mvmurthy/full-stack-hello-world-voting-ethereum-dapp-tutorial-part-1-40d2d0d807c2), if you are so inclined.
