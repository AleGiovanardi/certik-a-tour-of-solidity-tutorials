# Transfering Tokens

The ERC20 interface is not an interface for a token per se, as much as it is an interface for a token registry. That is to say: the smart contract we will deploy does not represent a single token deployed on the blockchain, but rather it represents the state and distribution of all the tokens of a particular type.

Essentially, we want our smart contract to be an accounting-book that keeps track of how much of our token each user has in their account. When one user transfers a certain amount of our token to another user, we should update our accounting-book.

Think back to the data structures we discussed in earlier sections and consider what might be an appropriate structure for representing this accounting-book. Then implement the `transfer` function to transfer tokens from one user to another user. Also go ahead and implement `balanceOf`, a function which should display the token balance of any given user addressed passed in as a parameter. 

To do: 

1. Implement `transfer`

2. Implement `balanceOf` 

> NOTE: Make sure you include a check to make sure nobody can transfer tokens that they don't have!
