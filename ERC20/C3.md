# Mint & Burn

In order to have any tokens at all in our contract, we will need a way to create them. 

There is no function for minting specified in the ERC20 token standard, so it's up to you how you want to do this. I highly recommend you prevent anyone other than the owner from calling this function however, since a token that absolutely anyone can create more of at a whim is not especially valuable. (Perhaps if you want you can put some extra restrictions on how many tokens the owner can create as well.)

The ERC20 standard does, however, specify a `totalSupply()` function that should return the total number of tokens created. So you will need to figure out a way to properly keep track of this number when you write your minting function. 

Most token contracts will also implement a function to burn tokens, which does the opposite of minting - it destroys tokens and lowers the overall token count. This can be useful from an economic perspective because due to the laws of supply and demand, burning a certain amount of tokens should make the remaining tokens more valuable. Go ahead and implement this function too. 

To do: 

1. Implement a function for minting tokens

2. Implement the `totalSupply` function

3. Implement a function for burning tokens
