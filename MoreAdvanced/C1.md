# Advanced

In this module, we will learn more about solidity's features, including inline &standalone assembly calls, returning & accepting multiple arguments, utilizing abi, and so on.

Some of these features might be very useful in certain special circumstances. Knowing them will help you get through tricky situations that would otherwise have you stuck.

Let's begin!

# Bit Operations

Since Solidity deals with bits and bytes more often than other programming languages, it is quite helpful to review and make sure you know the bit operations.
The list of possible bitwise operations are below.

  1. left shift `y`: `x << y` (equivalent to `x * 2**y`).
  
  2.  right shift `y`: `x >> y`  
    1. equivalent to `x / 2**y` if `x >= 0`.  
    2. equivalent to `(x + 1) / 2**y - 1` if `x < 0`.

  3. bitwise and: `x & y`
  
  4. bitwise or:`x | y`
  
  5. bitwise xor: `x ^ y`  
    1. bitwise xor is "exclusive or". It translates to `a` or `b` and not (`a` and `b`)

In all cases, shifting by a negative y throws a runtime exception.  
Some of these operators can be applied to different types (if `x` is of type `bytes32` and `y` is of type `uint`, we can apply shifts, but not other operatiors.), but they are mostly limited to shifts.

Try it yourself

  1. Make all the functions pass by changing the value `r`.
