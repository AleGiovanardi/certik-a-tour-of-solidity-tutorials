# Math and Cryptographic Operations

Like other programming languages, Solidity provides some useful mathematical operations to assist developers write smart contracts. In addition to simple math functions, it also provides some useful cryptographic functions.

These are the list of the functions available in Solidity:

1.  addmod(uint x, uint y, uint k) returns (uint):  
compute (x + y) % k where the addition is performed with arbitrary precision and does not wrap around at 2**256. Assert that k != 0 starting from version 0.5.0.

2.  mulmod(uint x, uint y, uint k) returns (uint):  
compute (x * y) % k where the multiplication is performed with arbitrary precision and does not wrap around at 2**256. Assert that k != 0 starting from version 0.5.0.

3.  keccak256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32):  
compute the Keccak-256 hash of the input

4.  sha256(bytes memory) returns (bytes32):  
compute the SHA-256 hash of the input

5.  ripemd160(bytes memory) returns (bytes20):  
compute RIPEMD-160 hash of the input

6.  ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address):  
recover the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error.  

The function parameters correspond to ECDSA values of the signature:  
r = first 32 bytes of signature s = second 32 bytes of signature v = final 1 byte of signature

ecrecover returns an address, and not an address payable. See address payable for conversion, in case you need to transfer funds to the recovered address.

I've made a small contract consisting of functions that call those functions above. Feel free to make changes and see how they work.
