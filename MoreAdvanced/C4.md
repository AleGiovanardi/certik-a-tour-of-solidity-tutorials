# Function Overloading

Like many other programming languages that are flexible enough, Solidity provides function overloading. This can be useful in many different ways, since Solidity does not support optional arguments.  

Let's see a simple example first.

```
function sub(uint a, uint b) public returns(uint) {
  require(b <= a, "uint underflow");
  return a - b;
}
function sub(uint a, uint b, string memory errorMessage) public returns(uint) {
  require(b <= a, errorMessage);
  return a - b;
}
```

The above case is a very simple example of going around optional arguments with function overloading. 

Note: If the two overloading functions have the same external types but differ in the solidity types, the contract will not compile. A simple example is below.

```
pragma solidity ^0.5.10;

// This will not compile
contract A {
    function f(B _in) public pure returns (B out) {
        out = _in;
    }

    function f(address _in) public pure returns (address out) {
        out = _in;
    }
}

contract B {
}
```

Since `address` and `Contract` have the same external type (same literal), this won't compile, even though `Contract` and `address` are of different types.

Try yourself:

  1. Try overloading some of the functinos from the contract below to make them simpler. Remove the additional string parameters from different functions.
