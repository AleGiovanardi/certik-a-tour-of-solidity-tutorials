# Writing the First Function

Now that we have defined our state variables, let's write the functions that are going to change/view the state of the game for it be functional.

The first function we will write is the **constructor function** to create the initial state of the contract. In many cases, you want to store the address of the creator for administrative purposes. 

> Tip: constructor functions are called when the contract is first created, and can be never accessed afterwards.

A `constructor` function looks like this:

```
constructor() public {
  /***do something***/
}
```

`msg.sender` will give you the address of the caller of the function. So, inside constructor functions, `msg.sender` will be the creator of the contract.

We can declare in the constructor that the owner is Player 1 in the tic tac toe game . But we will need a way for another player to join. A public function to set Player 2 will be a good way to do this. 

> (Make sure you put in proper checks on this function to make sure the game doesn't end up in an invalid state!)

Try it yourself:

1. Write a constructor function 
2. Write a function which allows another player to join the game
