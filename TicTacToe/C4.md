# Moving Forward

Now, we want our players to be able to place `X`'s and `O`'s on the board to play tic-tac-toe. 

Write a function that allows a player to make their turn in the tic-tac-toe game. They should be able to pass information in the function parameter that tells the contract which square they would like to place their symbol on. The contract should then modify the state to apply the player's move. It should then become the next player's turn.

> Make sure you put in proper checks on your function so that the player does not make any illegal moves, and that players are forced to take turns as is appropriate.
