# Security Check

Great, we've completed our game! Before we rest on our laurels, however, let's take a chance to make sure that there are no holes in our contract waiting to be exploited. 

Once a smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, it cannot be changed. This means that any bugs will be there forever unless we catch them before we deploy.

Remember that anyone can call our contract's public methods with whatever data they want, even mischevious or malicious people. If they call methods in a way that puts our contract in an invalid state, there might not be anything we can do about it. This is not such a big deal for a tic-tac-toe game, but once we start adding money to our smart contracts (like we will in the next chapter) it will become very important to prevent agaist.

Before moving on, ensure that:

- Once two players have joined the game, no one else can join or "overwrite" them as active players
- Players cannot play unless it is their turn
- Players cannot play on squares that have already been played on
- If a player passes in an invalid location for their move, the contract reverts and no turn is made
- Players cannot play after the game is over
