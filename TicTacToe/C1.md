# Introduction

If you're familiar with the state of Ethereum smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps), you have probably heard of game development on smart contracts. Let's make our own basic game: a game of tic-tac-toe. 

Here's some basic rules for tic-tac-toe:

1. Starting with player1, the two players will take turns placing `X`'s and `O`'s on the board.

2. The first player places `X`'s, and the second player places `O`'s.

3. The creator of the game (the contract) will be player1, and another person that joins the game will be player2.

4. The player who makes a line on the board with 3 `X`'s or `O`'s wins.

There are some other minor rules as well:

1. You cannot override/replace already placed `X`'s or `O`'s.

2. You cannot play your turn when the game has a winner.

3. The size of the board is 3 * 3.

Unlike in the past lesson, we will write a brand new smart contract entirely from scratch here.

The first thing we need to include is the `pragma` header to define the compiler version.  

```
pragma solidity >=0.5.10 <0.6.0;
```

In the above script, `pragma` declares the solidity version of this contract. The above snippet specifies that the solidity version be newer or equal to version 0.5.10 and up to, but not including, version 0.6.0\. As the newest version available at the time of writing is 0.5.10, we'll use this as our solidity version.

> Tip: usually any breaking changes will happen at version X.Y.0, where X or Y is a new, higher number than the previous version. The last digit usually will be a bugfix or minor change that doesn't break.

Next, we need to build the actual contract. the keyword `contract` will handle that for us:

```
contract TicTacToe {

}
```

Go ahead and do it yourself:

Write the solidity version pragma and declare a contract named `TicTacToe`. Make the solidity version equal to `0.5.10`.
