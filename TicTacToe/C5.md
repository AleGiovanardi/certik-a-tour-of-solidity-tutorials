# Checking Some Conditions

Now we have a functional board that takes player's move as input. However, the game can't end if we don't have a way to check whether the game has ended.

Let's write a `view` function that players can use to check to see if the game has been won. It should be able to return three possible states: player 1 has won, player 2 has won, or nobody has won yet. 

See if you can write a function that checks the board for a three-in-a-row victory condition. It might be useful to review the syntax for the`for` loop and `if` statements:

```
for(uint i =0; i < 10; i++){
  /* do something */
}
```

```
if(whoseTurn == 1){
    /** player1's turn **/
}else if(whoseTurn == 2){
    /** player2's turn **/
}else{
  /* who's turn? */
}
```

Both the `for` loop and `if` statements follow the typical syntax from programming languages like Javascript, C, and C++.
