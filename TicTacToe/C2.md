# Filling in the Contract

Now that we have a contract to work with, we can start building the game!

The first thing we can do is to create the variables necessary to track the contract's state.

We will need:

1. A way to represent the board. This needs to hold spots for the nine positions on the three by three board. Positions on the board can hold one of three values - an X, an O, or empty.
2. The addresses of the two players of the game.
3. A variable to track whose turn it is.

Go ahead and define the state variables in the empty contract. Use whatever types you think would be appropriate to do the job.

Here's a reference for the Solidity types we introduced in the previous lesson:

<table>
   <tbody>
   <tr>
     <td><b>name</b></td>
     <td><b>example</b></td>
     <td><b>zero value</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>bool</td>
    <td>true</td>
    <td>false</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>uint</td>
    <td>124512</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>"Oboe player"</td>
    <td>""</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>address</td>
    <td>0xd0a6E6C54DbC68Db5db3A091B171A77407Ff7ccf</td>
    <td>0x0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>array of type T</td>
    <td>[3, 5, 4, 6, 4]</td>
    <td>[T(0), T(0), T(0) ... ]</td>
  </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>

Note: `uint` and `int` are shorthands for `uint256` and `int256`. This is important when we are concerned with the size of the variables for optimization.

In the next section we will begin writing the functions to modify these variables.
