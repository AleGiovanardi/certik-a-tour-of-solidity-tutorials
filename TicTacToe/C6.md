# Checking some conditions (cont.)

Now we can place stuff on the board, and decide who won the game. With some additional work, we can write a function that even lets us visualize the game board.

Let's write a function that returns who won the game and the board's state.

Since we need to use `string` for this function, here's how to declare a string variable:

```
  string memory mystring;
  mystring = "asdf";
  string memory text = "my string";
```

Try yourself:
write a funtion named currentState that returns the state of the board.

1. The function's name should be `currentState`. It should be `public view`, and it should return two `string memory`.
2. Following are corresponding strings for winning state:
   1. nobody: `"No winner yet"`
   2. player1: `"Winner is X"`
   3. player2: `"Winner is O"`
3. Follow the template code to finish string generation for the board.
