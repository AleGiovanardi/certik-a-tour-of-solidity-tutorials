# Mapping vs Array

When storing some list of big data into the contract (like addresses and token amounts), we have two primitive types that could help us: Mappings and Arrays.

There are pros and cons to using both types. Mappings are generally cheaper (gas wise) than Arrays and has faster access time. However, it is quite hard to iterate through a mapping, since it only has key-value pairs (we can't only get keys out of a mapping.) The main strength of Arrays is that it allows element iteration.

Try yourself:

  1. Inside the contract, declare two variables:
     * a `uint` array of dynamic length named `a`
     * a `mapping(uint=>uint)` named `m`
  1. Inside the contract, declare two functions:
     * a function named `seta` that takes no arguments and pushes three integers `0, 1, 2` to `a`
     * a function named `setm` that maps `i` to `i` from `0` to `2`, resulting in `m[0] = 0, m[1] = 1, m[2] = 2`.

Compile the contract and see how the gas prices of the two functions differ from each other.
