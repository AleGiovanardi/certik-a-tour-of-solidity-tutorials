# String vs Bytes Array

One of the frequently used type is `string`, when you want to deal with some sort of a readable text within the contract.

While `string` may be useful, the EVM does not allow any operations on strings; you can't compare, modify, or even access string segments.

Why is this the case?

It is closely related to how EVM works. As you have experienced by now, EVM spends real value with each operation, and strings natively consumes a lot more operations than simple variables, especially when each characters can take different number of bytes.

Let's see an example from another tutorial.

```
pragma solidity ^0.5.10;

contract StringTest {
    string a = "fsdf€bÁ";
    bytes b = "fsdf€bÁ";

    function gets() public view returns(string memory) {
      return a;
    }

    function getb() public view returns(bytes memory) {
        return b;
    }

    function getl() public returns(uint) {
        return bytes(a).length;
    }
}
```

If you test with `gets` and `getb` functions with the original string given, the gas consumption is about 20 lower in the `getb` function. It might look small, but it can build up! Also, there is another way to significantly reduce gas cost: making variables to fixed length. In the above example, let's try changing `b` to a `bytes32` type. Make changes accordingly to the functions as well, and see how it goes.
