# Selfdestruct

Like deleting storage variables, you can also delete a smart contract.
It is as simple as this : `selfdestruct(address payable)`. This will transfer any available value within the contract to the input argument, and delete the contract.

Deleting does not mean erasing from the blockchain history. The existance of the contract is available in the history of the blockchain. However, once delete goes through (the transaction committed), we can no longer access the contract.

Let's create a simple contract for testing and destroying.

Try it yourself:
Assume the contract given will be no longer useful once one function is called. Add `selfdestruct` within the function call and see how the gas cost changes.
