# uint8 vs uint256

Now we saw that using as little space as possible makes our lives better. But in this chapter, we will explore some oddities.

Let's say I have a struct that only contains an integer value (weird design, but let's suppose we do). Since the integer value is always guaranteed to be really small (`0 < i < 50`), I set it to a `uint8` type, since I think smaller types consume less gas.

However, this consumes even **more** gas than just having it a `uint`, or `uint256`. Since EVM only works with integers of size 256 bits, in order for it to work with the variable, it first has to convert the variable to a `uint256`, which will then cost gas before even starting to work with the variable.

Thus, unless you're packing variables to fit in the 256 storage units, it is better to just use a type of 256 bits rather than trying to make it as small as possible.

Try it yourself:

  1. We declared two types of unsigned integers: `a` of type `uint256` and `b` of type `uint8`.
  2. For the two variables, write functions `geta()` and `getb()` that returns `a` and `b`, respectively.
  3. Also, for the two variables, write functions `seta(uint256 i)` and `setb(uint8 i)` that assigns i to the respective variables.
  4. Compile and compare the gas costs of the functions.

Also, notice that the order of the declarations of `a` and `b` matters for variable packing.
