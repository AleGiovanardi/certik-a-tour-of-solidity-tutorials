# Withdrawing the Funds

Now the owner of the contract can collect values from donators for fundraising.

However, the current contract only collects values and does not transfer it to somewhere. If the contract goes online now, it will just endlessly collect values without sending it to anybody. Thats bad! :/

Also, we need to make sure that the owner of the contract is recorded when the contract is created: let's use a `constructor` function for that.

Let's add a functionality such that the owner can withdraw the collected funds to his account. We will also add a constraint that only the owner of the contract can withdraw funds from the contract.

> Reminder: we can access the caller of the account with `msg.sender`.

Try yourself:
  1. Write a constructor function that stores the caller of the function as the `owner` state variable.
  2. Write a function called `withdrawOwner` that allows the owner (only the owner) to withdraw funds from the contract. Return appropriate error messge if the caller is not the owner.
