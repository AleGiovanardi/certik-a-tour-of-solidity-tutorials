# Additional features

Great! Now we have a fully fuctional smart contract that will collect funds from donators and let the owner withdraw from a successful campaign. It also lets the donators reclaim their funds after an unsuccessful campaign.

Still, there are some small changes here and there that we need to make in order to make the contract even more impressive.
1. We want to make sure the donators cannot donate to a finished campaign, since their money will simply go to waste
2. We want a feature to monitor the contract and see the progress.

To make this work, we need some additional functionalities:  

  1. A flag that keeps track of whether the campaign is open to donations or not. 
  2. Let's introduce a function to monitor the progress of the campaign. This can simply return a percentage value representing how close to its goal the fundraising campaign is.
