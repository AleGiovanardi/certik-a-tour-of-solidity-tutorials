# Additional features

Great! Now we have a fully fuctional smart contract that will collect funds from donators and let the owner withdraw from a successful campaign. It also lets the donators reclaim their funds after an unsuccessful campaign.

Still, there are some small changes here and there that we need to make in order to make the contract even more impressive.
1.  we want to make sure the donators cannot donate to a finished campaign, since the owner of the campaign might not want to keep track of all his campaigns for some mistaken donators' lost funds.
2. we want a feature to monitor the contract and see the progress.

To make this work, we need some additional functionalities:  

  1. a function to monitor the progress of the campaign
  3. a flag that keeps track of whether the campaign is open to donations or not

Try yourself:

  1. add a state variable called `open` that is initialized as `true` and set to `false` when the owner withdraws the funds.
  2. add a constraint in `add` such that it rejects further donations if `open` is set to `false`. Also, require the value is greater than `0`.
  3. add a function called `monitor` that returns the percentage of the progress until the goal in percentage. Require the `goal` is not `0`.
  4. add a constraint that the donator has to donate more than 0 Ether.
