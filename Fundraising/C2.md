# A Proper Setup

Great! Now our smart contract can accept Ether. We can start adding some more functionality on top of this. 

First, we need some state variables to keep track of the donations. You can refer back to some previous sections (like TicTacToe chapter 2) if you need any assistance.

Second, we need a `mapping` that will keep track of the source of the values.

Then we need to store the address and the value in corresponding variables, just like the example code in Chapter 1.

Try it yourself:

  1. Add an `address payable` called `owner`.
  2. Add three `uint public`, each called `goal`, `endTime`, and `total`. Initialize `total` to `0`.
  3. Add a `mapping` called `donations` that maps from `address` to `uint`.
  4. Add functionality to `add` function to:
     * keep track of the source of the transferred values via `donations` mapping.
     * add the amount of value transferred to `total`.
