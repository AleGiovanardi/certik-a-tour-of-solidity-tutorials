# Adding Some More constraints

We now have some basic fundraising features, but we're not quite there yet. In order to satisfy the stated requirements, we need some more work to do.

Let's start out by adding some content in `withdraw`. It might seem like a good design to automatically transfer all remaining funds to the origin once the fundraising is not complete. However, this can lead to a security vulnerability.

Suppose we are iterating through an array to refund the collected values back to the donators. Suppose there is a malicious donator, Bob, who wants to break the iteration and stop the refunding process. Knowing that running out of gas can cause an exception and revert the transaction, Bob writes a smart contract with an infinite loop fallback function. Then, Bob will donate to the fundraising project through this contract. When there is a refund, this contract will receive Ether, triggering the fallback function. However, the fallback function runs out of gas because of the infinite loop, and the transaction raises an exception and stops the iteration. 

Let's recall the constraints on the donators' `withdraw` functionality:

  1. they cannot withdraw their funds before the `endTime`. return a proper error message when the condition is not met.
  2. they cannot withdraw their funds when the goal is met. return a proper error message when the condition is not met.
  3. they will have to manually call the function for their refund.
  4. they will get refunded the amount they donated on a single transaction.

That somewhat looks like a lot of constraints, but most of them are only one line of code each. Let's code away!
