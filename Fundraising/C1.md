# Grabbing the Money

In this module, we will build a fundraising smart contract from scratch. Fundraising smart contracts can be used to crowdfund a project such as a new blockchain platform. Like ERC20, this kind of fundraising method has been prevalent with ICO's.

Reminder: `payable` enables the function to accept values when called. A brief example of a payable function is described below.

```
function add() payable public {
      uint v = msg.value;
}
```

This `add` function will accept incoming value and capture it in a `uint v`. Note while the function itself does not do anything with the value given, the incoming Ether is still stored in the contract after the function terminates.

Try it yourself:

  1. We need to start off the entire file. write `pragma`, version equal to `^0.5.10`.
  2. Write a contract named `FundRaising`.
  3. In the contract, write a function named `add`, which should be able to take in public transfers of Ether.
  4. Leave the function empty for now, as we need to add more stuff inside the contract to make the function work.
