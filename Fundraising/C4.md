# Refund policy

Now the owner can withdraw from the pool to his account! :sunglasses:

However, we still want to make some improvements to the contract. Let's say the donators only want to give the donation to the owner of the contract when a goal is met. Since they do not want to give their money to an unsuccessful fundraising project, this makes sense.

Let's start off the most basic functionality to support this feature.

  1. A goal and a time limit for the fundraising project
  2. The ability to withdraw to donators when the goal is not met within the given time limit
  3. Something that blocks donators from withdrawing after the goal has been met.

And to enforce these conditions, we will have to add some more constraints on the functions as well.

Try it yourself:

  1. In the constructor function, add two additional parameters:
     * a `uint` named `_goal`
     * a `uint` named `_timelimit`
  2. In the constructor function, store `_goal` to `goal`. Store `block.number + timelimit` as `endTime`. This will store the current block height + timelimit as the end time block height.
  3. Add a constraint in `withdrawOwner` such that it doesn't execute when `total` is less than `goal`.
  4. Add a `public` function `withdraw`

We will finish the functionalities in the next section.
