# Interface

Like other popular programming languages, solidity supports abstractions to allow blueprinting contracts. Let's see an example:

```
contract LegalContract {
  function sign() public;
}
```

Here, we see a very simple contract-looking code that basically does nothing. This is what's called an `interface`--it provides a base for other contracts to build on. Let's build on it so it can be used for something useful:

```
contract AdultContract is LegalContract {
  function sign() public returns() {

  }
}
```

The adult can sign anything whenever they want. We can also create another contract off of `LegalContract`:

```
contract ChildContract is LegalContract {
  bool signed_by_parent = false;
  function get_signature(address _parent) public {
    signed_by_parent = true;
  }

  function sign() public {
    require(
      signed_by_parent,
      "need parent's signature."
    );
  }
}
```

Here, the `ChildContract` needs a parent's signature to sign a `LegalContract` for themselves. But how do we access other contract's data and interact with them? We will find out in a later tutorial.

Try yourself:

Let's build some basic interface and implement them!

  1. create an interface called `Animal`. write two prototypes:
     * a string called `name`
     * a function called `makeSound` that is `public` and returns `string memory`
  1. create two contracts below `Animal`:
     * a contract called `Cat` that has name `cat` and returns the string `meow` when called `makeSound`
     * a contract called `Dog` that has name `dog` and returns the string `bark` when called `makeSound`
