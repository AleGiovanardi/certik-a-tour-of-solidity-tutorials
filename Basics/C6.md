### Modifiers

When writing smart contracts, it's very common to have restricted functions like the one we just wrote which reverts unless the owner calls it. Solidity provides an easy way to use the same restriction logic over and over with a language feature called "modifiers". 

A modifier is a function that wraps around another function. You can define some logic in the modifier that executes before the logic in the function it modifies runs, and you can define some logic that executes after. It looks something like this:

```
modifier myModifier() { 
  //do something before the function calls
  runningFunction = true; 
  _;
  //do something after the function calls
  runningFunction = false; 
}
```
The `_` character is a reference to the function that this modifier is modifying. At the point in the code execution when the modifier reaches the underscore, the function will run. So this is a modifier that sets a state variable to true before the function runs and sets it back to false afterwards. 

To use a modifier, call it in the signature of the function after the scope but before the return value. A function that uses a modifier might look something like this: 

```
function coolFunction() public payable myModifier() {
  // function body here
}
```

In the code on the right, we have moved the restriction on `setYourFavoriteNumber` into a modifier. Can you do the same for the restriction on `withdraw`?
