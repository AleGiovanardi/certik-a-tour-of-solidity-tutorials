### Structs

Another useful tool in Solidity is the `struct`. A struct, like a contract, is similar to a class in other programming languages, except while a class can contain state variables and functions, a struct only has state variables. It is essentially just a way to group together related data.  

```
struct Person {
  string firstName;
  string lastName;
  uint age;
  address ethAddress;
}
```
Here is a possible example struct describing a person. There are two ways we can initialize this data:

Way 1, the shorter way. Just pass in an initial value for each variable in the struct in the order that they're defined.

`Person p = Person("Ariana", "Grande", 26, 0x41ae39cfa52a510de7973005c33f62107676d88d)`

Way 2, the javascript-object style way. This takes longer to write but it's easier to see at a glance what the meaning of each variable is.

`Person p = Person({ firstName:"Ariana", lastName:"Grande", age:26, ethAddress:0x41ae39cfa52a510de7973005c33f62107676d88d)}}`

One we have a struct, we can access and modify variables inside it using dot notation:

`p.age = p.age + 1; //happy birthday Ariana!!` 

Like with mappings, uninitialized values in structs will hold the zero value for their particular types. 

```
Person p2;
uint256 a = p2.age; // a will be set to 0 
string b = p2.firstName; // b will be set to ""
```

A struct can also be used as the value type for a mapping.

`mapping(uint => Person) peopleList;` 

Try using structs to store the amount of money that each user has sent the function so far alongside what their favorite number is.
