# ![Image of Parachuate](/static/assets/parachute.png#parachute) Hello, World!

CertiK is proud to present the Solidity Tour, a resource for beginners wishing to learn the Solidity programming language for Ethereum smart contract development.

In our Solidity playground we've created, you can create fully functional smart contracts and deploy them to a simulated blockchain that runs in the browser. This is the first online Solidity tutorial that gives you the freedom to actually develop, compile, and run whatever smart contracts your imagination can come up with as you explore and learn the language.

The tutorial is designed for people that have some programming experience. You should be able to write simple programs in at least one other language.

If you are coming to this tutorial with a basic understanding about how blockchain and Ethereum work, click the link below to skip straight to the first lesson! Otherwise, you can read an introductory article we have written: [Smart Contracts 101](TODO link here when this is published). It should give you a very high-level sense of what a smart contract is and how it allows you to perform decentralized computation on something called "the blockchain". Take a moment to read it and come back when you are ready to begin your journey as a smart contract programmer.
